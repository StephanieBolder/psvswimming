            text: "Following the measures that RIVM and the Cabinet had to take as a result of the corona crisis, the KNZB has decided to stop all competitions of the 2019/2020 season. This decision applies to all levels of jumping, synchronized swimming, water basketball, water polo and competitive swimming. The corona virus and its consequences for Dutch society also have a major impact on swimming. Swimming pools are closed and club life has come to a halt. There is no longer a normal training regimen for both top athletes and those who are active as athletes at other levels. Exactly what this decision means for the different sports will be further elaborated in the next two weeks. Contributions will be collected on sports technical, organizational and financial aspects and a balanced decision will be made. The Federal Bureau will contact the regional committees, the various task and working groups and its associations. Before Easter, it will be clear for every swimming discipline what the consequences of the corona virus will be for the start of the 2020/2021 season. In order to remain fit in the coming weeks, various top athletes and trainers give daily tips via the various social media channels. With this we hope to contribute to the fitness of all Dutch people",

            text: "In April, the Dutch swimming federation (KNZB) secretly used its own swimming pool in Zeist - back then against the guidelines - for training swimmers. After sports dome NOC * NSF reacted furiously, technical director AndrÃ© Cats has to do some damage control on behalf of the KNZB. We have crossed the border, said Cats Sunday evening at Studio Sport. Every relationship is sometimes scratched, we will have to work hard to remove it. 'Water feeling'. According to Cats, the swimming federation made a big mistake. The KNZB had already been slapped on the wrist in March when an alternative training camp was set up in Drachten. The Olympic Games had not been postponed to 2021 at the time of that pool use. When swimming, feeling water is very important. At that time we still felt the urgency of the Games, said Cats.",
